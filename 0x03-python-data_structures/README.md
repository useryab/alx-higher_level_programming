**Tasks**

**0. Print a list of integers**

     Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

* Prototype: def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):
* Format: one integer per line. See example
* You are not allowed to import any module
* You can assume that the list only contains integers
* You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
* You have to use str.format() to print integers

**1. Secure access to an element in a list**
